# PSP Komanda32 Laboratory work nr.2 - API



#### Description
Our main goal is to create an API that would allow our clients to perform any necessary actions that are needed for managing their day-to-day operations.
So far we've grouped all requests into 5 groups. All of those groups represent a specific order or type of requests.

The groups are as follows:
- Manage Employees
  - Management of Employees
  - Management of Couriers
- Manage Orders
  - Management of Orders
  - Management of Order (this is different from the "Orders" table - this holds information about the delivery of orders)
  - Management of Reservations
- Manage Prices
  - Management of Discounts
  - Management of Taxes
- Manage Product Services
- Manage Shifts
